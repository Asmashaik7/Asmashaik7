## 🌱 About Me

I'm transitioning into the tech field with a focus on **Python development, SQL, and Power BI**.  
After a planned career break, I am rebuilding my technical foundation with hands-on projects, structured learning, and consistent practice.

I believe in learning by doing — every project I build represents progress, not perfection.
